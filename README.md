<h3 align="center"> 💻 Multi-Language Code Showcase </h3>

<p align="center">
  <b>Project Asgard</b> is a cross-language programming repository that demonstrates 
  how the same idea can be expressed across multiple modern programming languages.  
  Each snippet highlights syntax style, ecosystem strengths, and language personality.

## 🚀 About This Project
This project is designed as a **multi-language showcase** to explore:

- 🌍 The diversity of modern programming ecosystems.  
- 🛠️ How different languages handle structure, syntax, and output.  
- 📚 A reference hub for students, developers, and enthusiasts learning multiple languages.  

Rather than focusing on complex applications, this repository highlights **core code snippets** in popular languages used in today’s projects — from backend systems to data science, web apps, and beyond.

## 📂 Code Showcase

---

### 1) Java — Boot Sequence
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("[Episode 01/12] BOOT: Beacon online. Handshake initiated — Java node ready.");
    }
}
```

---

### 2) Python — Config Loaded
```python
def run():
    print("[Episode 02/12] CONFIG: Profiles loaded. Routing secrets to volatile memory — Python engaged.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

---

### 3) C++ — Channel Established
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "[Episode 03/12] LINK: Secure channel established. Heartbeat steady — C++ holding." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 4) C# — Credentials Verified
```csharp
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("[Episode 04/12] AUTH: Multi-factor verified. Access token minted — C# greenlight.");
    }
}
```

---

### 5) C — Sensors Calibrated
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("[Episode 05/12] CALIB: Telemetry synced. Noise floor minimized — C baseline stable.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

---


### 6) JavaScript — Target Resolved
```js
(() => {
  console.log("[Episode 06/12] RESOLVE: Target signature triangulated — JavaScript lock acquired.");
})();
```

---

### 7) TypeScript — Plan Compiled
```ts
function execute(plan: string): void {
  console.log(`[Episode 07/12] COMPILE: Strategy '${plan}' transpiled — TypeScript validates.`);
}
execute("Silent Uplink v1.0");
```

---

### 8) Rust — Systems Armed
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("[Episode 08/12] ARM: Ownership secured, race-free channel primed — Rust standing by.");
}
```

---

### 9) PHP — Payload Packed
```php
<?php
echo "[Episode 09/12] PACKAGE: Payload serialized & signed — PHP bundle sealed.\n";
```

---

### 10) Go — Dispatch Launched
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("[Episode 10/12] DISPATCH: Goroutines fanned out — Go courier en route.")
}
```

---

### 11) Swift — Delivery Confirmed
```swift
import Foundation

print("[Episode 11/12] DELIVERY: Secure drop completed — Swift receipt acknowledged.")
```

---

### 12) R — Mission Complete
```r
cat("[Episode 12/12] STATUS: Signals green across the board — R confirms mission complete.\n")
```

## 🛠️ How to Run
Each language requires its respective compiler or runtime:

- **Java** → `javac HelloWorld.java && java HelloWorld`  
- **Python** → `python hello.py`  
- **C++** → `g++ hello.cpp -o hello && ./hello`  
- **C#** → `dotnet run`  
- **C** → `gcc hello.c -o hello && ./hello`  
- **JavaScript** → `node hello.js`  
- **TypeScript** → `tsc hello.ts && node hello.js`  
- **Rust** → `cargo run`  
- **PHP** → `php hello.php`  
- **Go** → `go run hello.go`  
- **Swift** → `swift hello.swift`  
- **R** → `Rscript hello.R`
